# Understanding the Data

This folder is dedicated to the crucial process of understanding the data in a machine learning project. Proper understanding of the data is foundational to building accurate and effective models. In this section, we explore four primary ways to achieve a comprehensive understanding of your data:

1. **Asking Questions**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Univariate**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Bivariate and Multivariate**
4. **Pandas Profiling**

### Disclaimer

The methods outlined here are not universally defined and can be categorized in different ways depending on the instructor or practitioner. The structure presented here is based on the way my instructor taught me. Other teachers or data scientists might have different approaches or categorizations. The main goal is to cover most aspects of understanding the data.

## 1. Asking Questions

The first step in understanding any dataset is to ask the right questions. These questions help to clarify the purpose of the analysis and the goals of the project. Common questions include:

- What is the structure of the dataset?
- What are the types of variables (categorical, numerical, etc.)?
- Are there any missing values?
- What is the distribution of the variables?
- Are there any outliers or anomalies?

This step sets the direction for the subsequent analysis and ensures that the right aspects of the data are examined.

## 2. EDA - Univariate

Univariate analysis involves examining each variable individually. The goal is to understand the distribution and properties of each variable. Techniques commonly used in univariate EDA include:

- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.)
- Visualization techniques (histograms, box plots, density plots, etc.)

This analysis helps to identify the central tendency, variability, and distribution shape of each variable, and can also highlight any potential data quality issues.

## 3. EDA - Bivariate and Multivariate

Bivariate and multivariate EDA involve examining relationships between two or more variables. This step is crucial for understanding interactions and dependencies within the data. Techniques include:

- Correlation analysis
- Scatter plots and pair plots
- Heatmaps
- Cross-tabulations and contingency tables

By analyzing these relationships, we can gain insights into how variables influence each other and identify potential predictors for the target variable.

## 4. Pandas Profiling

Pandas Profiling is a powerful tool that automates much of the EDA process. It generates a detailed report of the dataset, including:

- Summary statistics for each variable
- Correlations between variables
- Distribution plots
- Missing values analysis

Pandas Profiling provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset with minimal effort, making it an invaluable tool for quickly understanding the data.
