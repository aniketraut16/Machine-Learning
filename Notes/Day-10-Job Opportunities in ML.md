- **Data Storytelling:** The ability to explain complex data science concepts and the insights derived from models to both technical and non-technical stakeholders is essential.
- **Soft Skills:** Excellent communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills are required to work effectively with data engineers, analysts, and business stakeholders.
- **Software Skills:** Expertise in machine learning algorithms, libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn, and experience with data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation to prepare data for modeling.

**What You'll Do:**

- Imagine you work for a recommendation engine company. As a data scientist, you'd use your analytical skills to analyze user behavior data and build a model that predicts what movies a user might be interested in watching (machine learning algorithms). Understanding the business (business acumen) is key to ensuring the model recommendations are relevant and lead to increased user engagement. You'd then translate these complex findings into clear and concise reports (data storytelling) for product managers to implement.

**Salary Range (US):** $100,000 - $150,000 (depending on experience, industry, and the complexity of models built)

### 4. Machine Learning Engineer (MLE): The Model Maker

**Skills You'll Need:**

- **Analytical Skills:** While not the primary focus, analytical skills are still important for understanding the data used to train models and interpreting their outputs.
- **Business Acumen:** A basic understanding of the business domain can help MLEs prioritize projects that address critical business needs and ensure models are aligned with business goals.
- **Data Storytelling:** While the focus may be on technical implementation, MLEs may need to communicate the functionality and performance of models to stakeholders in a clear and concise way.
- **Soft Skills:** Excellent communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills are essential to work effectively with data scientists, developers, and other IT professionals.
- **Software Skills:** Strong foundation in software engineering principles and best practices to build, deploy, and maintain ML models in production environments. Expertise in machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn, and familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker or Azure Machine Learning for deployment and scaling. They should also have the ability to monitor and optimize the performance of models in production.

**What You'll Do:**

- As an MLE at a self-driving car company, you'd collaborate with data scientists on the development of models that can accurately identify objects on the road (analytical skills). Your understanding of the business (business acumen) can help prioritize the development of models for critical safety features. You'd then take these models and translate them into a software application that can be integrated into the car's autonomous driving system (software engineering skills). Finally, you'd monitor the performance of these models in real-world scenarios and identify opportunities for improvement (monitoring and optimization).
